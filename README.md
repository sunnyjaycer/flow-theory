# Flow Theory

Flow Theory is revolutionizing fixed-rate credit by bringing real cashflow to on-chain lending with real-time interest payments. Right now when you borrow on Aave, Compound, etc, interest starts formulaically accruing on your debt, but lenders donâ€™t get timely compensation for the risk theyâ€™re taking on by lending out their funds.

This results in: Higher interest rates for borrowers and lower rates for lenders on these protocols

Yet, itâ€™s very real in TradFi where We pay down our loans in instalments and lenders realize cash flow continuously.

Our "Flow Theory" is that the continuous repayment of on-chain debt will incentivize better terms of credit and improve the experience of on-chain credit markets.

The Flow Theory Offering is about fixed-interest borrowing and lending where:

    Interest must be paid in a continuous Superfluid money stream ðŸŒŠ
    Lenders donâ€™t have to claim interest - it shows up directly in their wallets âœ¨

Because Flow Theory routes interest payments straight to the wallets of lenders, none of The Flow Theoryâ€™s TVL is from accrued interest (ðŸ”¥)
