# User research

## Do you have user research or are you basing this ideaâ€™s problem statement on your own experience?

Basically, Flow Theory aims to experiment on how borrowers and lenders in DeFi would behave if the funds were literally coursing from
interest payment to lender pockets. Would the instant receiving of actual interest (as opposed to formulaic accrual that we see in 
traditional DeFi protocols like Aave or Maker) make lenders more willing to offer better rates? If borrowers are actually paying for 
the liquidity they've borrowed in real-time and compensating lenders for their risk immeadiately, I'd imagine this to be the case.

## Are you wanting to do more research with this idea as we go along?

I do, but probably won't have that much time to dive into the financial side of things as we go along. Maybe another time.

# Product Goals

## What will you consider a successful POC of flow theory for this hack?

Successful deployment of POC contracts with a working frontend on Polygon and Optimism and have a couple borrowers that are sending the protocol interest revenue.

## What is your requirements for a full POC in general? (if you know)

Borrow/Repay/Withdraw and Deposit Collateral for borrower
Deposit and Withdraw Liquidity for lender
Should have 2 dashboards for both sides

## Do you have long term goals for Flow theory or is this tool an experiment for a larger idea? is it a smalll piece of something else?

It's a bit of an experiment. I want the concept to attract developers the way Supercard did and develop it in my spare time. The "big 
picture" is the concept of real cashflow in DeFi.

# Dashboard(s)

## how many other dashboards are we making?

We're making 2 dashboards for the borrower and lender.

Is there going to be a user profile with stats and analytics, personally across other platforms and/or just for this platform?

We'll just stick with the 2 dashs that a borrower can show up and check out their stats for.

Where do you want to start building this? From the tool portion (below) or from the (multi) platform stats part?

I'm good with starting with the Flow Theory design we've kicked off with:
